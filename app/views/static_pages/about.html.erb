<p>I had a thought one day that it might be cool to make some kind of competition for photos. Like reddit, but with two photos at a time. One up or one down ranking systems encourage populist things to rise in the rankings wildly. Things everyone vaguely approves of hit the front page of reddit all the time. I think with this system, we could find more concrete rankings based on quality rather than vague public approval. Also, with this site, you get to load two pictures at a time. That's twice the picture, people. </p>
<p>I'm thinking that given enough time, we could make a complete leaderboard of any category of picture. The cutest of cats, that sexiest of cars, the most lovable of landscapes. Also, I think that some kind of selfie category could help people find out how attractive they are to people that aren't their mothers, or help all the narcisists garner some validation. Could be fun at least. I'm curious to see what people will come up with.  </p>
<p>Thanks for checking it out, this should be interesting.</p>
